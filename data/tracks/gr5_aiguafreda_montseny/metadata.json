    "description": "First part of a 2 day hike from the train station of Aiguafreda to the village of Montseny. The route is part of the GR-5 route that goes from Sitges to Canet de Mar. From the train station you can go up to Turo de Tagamanent where you have amazing views over \"el Valles\" and Osona on the other side. Then you pass the Area that's called Pla de la calma, or Plain of calmness. The area really did emit calmness on this late summer day. After this you start the descent towards Montseny which takes you through a small goat path through the forest that is quite steep. Just before arriving to the village of Montseny there is a river which is great to cool the feet. Overall I really liked this route as you pass through several very different types of landscapes. It is on the difficult side though because of the positive and negative gain so be sure to be well."
