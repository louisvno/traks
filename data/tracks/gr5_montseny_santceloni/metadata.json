    "description": "Second part of a 2 day hike from Montseny to the train station of Sant Celoni. After a great breakfast in the hostel, I continued my way to Sant Celoni. The path takes you through the forest with a lot of impressively big chestnut trees. A part of the original GR-5 route seemed to be damaged during a storm in winter. Luckily an alternative path had already been created. Leaving the natural park and looking back to the Montseny mountains, dark clouds were forming as the next day it would rain all day."
