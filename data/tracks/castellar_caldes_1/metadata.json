    "description": "Nice gradual climb on good gravel eventually ends up in a small town el Farellet. From there its is a very smooth descent on a quite new asphalt road into Caldes de Montbui. Entering the town there is some bone-shaking cobblestone so you might want to cheat a bit and go on the sidewalk.",
